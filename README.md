# Greatest Generator Ever!

## Description

This program generates a password using JavaScript. Once the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, a JS function runs,
asking the user to select parameters to generate their unique, random password.

## Usage

Upon hitting the generate password button, the "generatePassword" function runs, asking the user to confirm whether or not they want
a specific criteria. 

The parameters are:

Choosing a password length, between 8 and 128 characters,

Asking the user if they want to include lowercase letters,

Asking the user if they want to include special characters,

If the user attempts to generate a password without specifying a length, this message appears:

If the user does not select any of the parameters, the password will not generate anything, as there are no parameters for the program to generate from.

I had two different collaborators on this project. Their names and github profiles will be below:

George Jordan Sr. - https://github.com/Judgedgeo - Bounced ideas between eachother, helping eachother solve problems as we worked on the project.
Matthew Recksiedler - https://github.com/mare8229 - Helped at the very end to finalize my code. Matthew has multiple years of experience on JavaScript, and his input was extremely helpful.

I also spent hours digging through the internet looking for solutions, including W3Schools, and Stackoverflow.
